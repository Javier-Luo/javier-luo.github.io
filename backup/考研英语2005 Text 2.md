①Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the doubters insisted that we didn’t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
还记得那些年吗？科学家们提出吸烟会使我们丧命，而怀疑者们却坚称我们对此无法定论；他们坚称证据不确凿，科学不确定；他们坚称反对吸烟的游说者企图破坏我们的生活方式，而政府应该置身事外。许多美国人听信了那些谬论，结果过去三十年间，大约一千万烟民过早地进了坟墓。

②There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth’s atmosphere is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The  clear message is that we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel’s report: “Science never has all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.”
如今，在科学家们前赴后继努力唤醒我们关注全球变暖这一与日俱增的威胁之时令人不安的类似情形再次出现。最新一轮（的科学家努力）是，受白宫邀请成立的国家科学院专家小组告诉我们，地球气候毫无疑问正在变暖，而且这一问题主要是人为造成的。(他们传达的) 明确信息是我们应该立刻着手保护自己。国家科学院院长布鲁斯·阿尔伯特在专家小组报告的前言中加上了这一重要观点：“科学从来都不能解答所有问题。但科学确实为我们提供了关于未来的最好的可行性指导，我们国家和整个世界在做重要决策时，应该以科学能够提供的关于人类当前行为对未来影响的最佳判断为依据，这一点至关重要。”

③Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about global warming is incomplete, that it’s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an insurance policy now.
就像在吸烟问题上一样，现在来自多方面的声音坚持认为有关全球变暖的科学研究还不完善，在我们证实这件事之前可以继续向大气中排放废气。这是一个危险的游戏：到证据百分之百确凿的时候，可能就太晚了。随着风险日益明显并加剧，明智谨慎的民族现在就应该采取范措施了。

④Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it’s obvious that a majority of the president’s advisers still don’t take global warming seriously. Instead of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research – a classic case of “paralysis by analysis”.
幸运的是，白宫开始关注此事。但很显然，大多数总统顾问仍旧没有严肃看待全球变暖这个问题。他们没有出台行动计划，相反，只是继续敦促进行更多研究一一典型的分析导致“瘫痪”的案例。

⑤To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration won’t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial  that those new plants be environmentally sound.
为了担负好地球保护者的责任，我们必须加紧推进对于大气和海洋的深入研究。但仅有研究还不够。如果政府不行使立法动议权，国会应当开始帮助制定保护措施。西弗吉尼亚的民主党参议员罗伯特·伯德提出的一项议案——为私企提供财政奖励——就是一个很有希望的开端。许多人看到我们国家正准备修建许多新发电厂，以满足我们的能源需求。如果我们想要保护大气，那么关键是要让这些新发电厂对环境无害。
