①While still catching up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way ahead in at least one undesirable category. “Women are particularly susceptible to developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,” according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York’s Veteran’s Administration Hospital.
尽管女性在现代生活中的不少领城仍在努力追赶男性，但至少在一个不利的方面女性似乎遥遥领先。据纽约退伍军人管理医院精神科主任医师耶胡达博士称，“相比男性，女性在应对压力时特别容易患抑郁症和焦虑症”。

②Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses became equal to those of the males.
对动物和人的研究都表明性激素会以某种方式影响压力反应，导致处于压力下的雌性比处于同等条件下的雄性分泌更多触发不良反应的化学物质。其中几项研究显示，如果将承受巨大压力的难鼠的卵巢（雌性生殖器官）切除，她们的化学反应变得和雄鼠相当。

③Adding to a woman’s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased “opportunities” for stress. “It’s not necessarily that women don’t cope as well. It’s  just that they have so much more to cope with,” says Dr. Yehuda. “Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men’s,” she observes, “it’s just that they’re dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.”
加重女性更多压力化学物质剂量的，是她们增多的压力“机会”。耶胡达博士说“未必是女性不能同样地应付压力。只是她们不得不应付多得多的压力。她说道，“女性忍受压力的能力甚至可能超过男性，只是她们需要应付如此之多的事，以致她们精疲力竭得更明显且更快。”

④Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. “I think that the kinds of things that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or  other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear  that comes from these longer relationships can be quite devastating.”
耶胡达博士还提到两性间的另一种差别。“我认为女性面临的各种事情往往更具长期性或反复性。男性去打仗，面临的是战斗压力。他们面临更多的是偶尔的身体上的暴力行为。女性面临的各种人际间暴力往往是在家庭环境中，不幸的是这种暴力来自于父母或其他家庭成员，而且往往不是一次了事。这些长久关系带来的折磨可能是极具毁灭性的”。

⑤Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish college. “I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.” Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. “It’s the hardest thing to take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. I lived from paycheck to paycheck.”
阿德琳·阿尔瓦雷兹十八岁结婚并生有一子，但她却坚决要完成大学学业。“为了拿到大学文凭我拼命努力。我的生活极其不如意，以至于我只有通过上学、取得进步并做得更好以摆脱现实困境。”后来，她的婚姻结束，她成了单身母亲。“照顾一个十来岁的孩子工作、交房租、付车款、还要偿还债务，这是最辛苦的事情。我过着勉强糊口的生活。”

⑥Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. Alvarez’s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before it threatens your health and your ability to function.
并不是每个人都承受着阿德琳·阿尔瓦雷兹描述的这种巨大的长期性压力。但如今大多数女性都担负着许多责任，几乎没有放松的时候，因此感到焦虑。阿尔瓦需兹的经历说明在压力威胁到你的健康和身体机能之前寻求途径缓解压力是相当重要的。
