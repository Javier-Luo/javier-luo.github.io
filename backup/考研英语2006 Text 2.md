①Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry  –  William Shakespeare – but there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, Shakespeare’s birthplace and the other sights.
众所周知，埃文河畔的斯特拉特福德镇只有一个产业——威廉·莎士比亚，却有两个泾渭分明且日益敌对的派别。一方是皇家莎士比亚剧团（RSC），它在埃文河畔的莎士比亚纪念剧院上演精彩绝伦的剧目。另一方是当地居民，他们在很大程度上依赖那些来此不是为了看戏，而是为了看安妮·海瑟薇 (注：莎士比亚的妻子) 小屋、莎士比亚出生地以及其他景点的观光客而生活。

②The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theater adds a penny to their revenue. They frankly dislike the RSC’s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals and noisiness. It’s all deliciously ironic when you consider that hakespeare, who earns their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.
斯特拉福德镇“令人尊敬”的居民们认为剧院没有为他们增添哪怕一分钱的收入。他们毫不掩饰地讨厌皇家莎士比亚剧团的演员：这些演员们留着长发、蓄着胡须、穿着凉鞋，吵吵嚷嚷。当你想到养活他们的莎士比亚本人就是个（留着胡须的）演员而且噪音制造也有他一份时，这真是绝妙的讽刺。

③The tourist streams are not entirely  separate.  The  sightseers  who  come  by  bus – and often take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side – don’t usually see the plays, and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC contends, who bring in much of the town’s revenue because they spend the night (some of them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.
旅客流并不是完全分离的。乘公交车过来的观光客经常顺道去参观华威城堡和布伦海姆宫，却通常不会去看戏，有些人甚至很惊讶地发现在斯特拉福德镇居然还有一家剧院。然而，看戏的人则除看戏之外还会设法抽出时间游览一些景点。皇家莎士比亚剧团坚称，正是看戏的
人带来了小镇的大部分收入，因为他们在此过夜（有些会住四到五个晚上），将大把的钱花在酒店和餐馆中。而观光者会在夜幕降临前游览完所有地方然后离开小镇。

④The townsfolk don’t see it this way and the local council does not contribute directly to the subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.
小镇居民并不这么认为，因而当地市政委员会也不直接出钱补贴皇家莎士比亚剧团。斯特拉特福德镇历来有哭穷的传统。然而镇上的每家旅馆似乎都在增建新的侧厅或酒吧间。希尔顿集团正在那里建造自己的酒店，你几乎可以肯定它会配备哈姆雷特汉堡吧、李尔休息室、班柯宴会包间等，而且会是非常奢华。

⑤Anyway, the townsfolk can’t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. (The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 seats were 94 per cent occupied all year long and this year they’ll do better.) The reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.
无论如何，当地居民都不能理解为什么皇家莎士比亚剧团需要补贴。（剧院连续三年打破上座记录。去年全年，其 1431 个座席的上座率达到 94%，而且今年的情况会更好。）当然，（剧院需要补贴的）原因是成本在飞涨，而票价却一直保持低位。

⑥It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people who are Stratford’s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the sights. They all seem to  look  alike  (though  they  come  from  all  over) – lean, pointed, dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.
大幅提价将会是一件令人蒙羞的事，因为这样做将会赶走那些作为“斯特拉福德镇最有吸引力的顾客”的年轻人。他们来这里纯粹是为了欣赏戏剧，而不是为了逛景点。虽然他们来自世界各地，但是看起来却都很相像——身材消瘦，棱角分明，表情专注，穿着牛仔裤和凉鞋，啃着圆面包，躺在剧院外的石板上过夜，等着在上午十点半售票处开门时购买预留给露宿者的 20 张坐票和 80 张站票。
