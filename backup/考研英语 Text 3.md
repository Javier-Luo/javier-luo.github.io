①During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard work and fair play to keep itself financially secure has been  transformed by economic risk and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or  a disappearing spouse can reduce a family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.
在过去一代人的时间里，原本依靠努力工作和公乎竞争便能保持自身经济安稳的美国中产阶级家庭已被经济风险和新的现实彻底改变现在，一张粉色小纸条（解雇通知书），一个恶性诊断结果，或者离散的配偶，都可以使一个家庭从殷实的中产阶级在几个月内沧为新贫阶层。

②In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming  basic family economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have  debated the social implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has risen as well. Today’ s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial setback – a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary earner got laid off or fell sick. This “added-worker effect” could support the safety net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.
在仅仅一代人的时间里，数百万母亲已出去工作，改变了基本的家庭经济（模式），学者、政策制定者以及各路评论家都已反复讨论这些变化的社会意义，但几乎没人仔细研究过其副作用：家庭风险也提高了。如今家庭的开支已达这种新双薪状态的极限结果，他们失去了经济受挫时期曾经拥有的“降落伞”——一个在家庭经济支柱失业或生病时可以走进职场的候补赚钱者（通常是母亲）。这种“附加的劳动者效应”能够增强失业保险或伤残保险所提供的安全保障网帮助家庭渡过难关。但如今，家庭时运遭到的破坏再也不能通过原本赋闲在家的另一半获得的额外收入得以弥补。

③During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a savings-account model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is  not any better. Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen——and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families’ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as the odds of having a weak elderly parent——and all the attendant need for physical and financial assistance – have jumped eightfold in just one generation.
与此同时，家庭被要求在退体收入方面承担（比以前）大得多的风险。钢铁工人、航空公司雇员以及现在汽车行业的员工正在加入数百万家庭，必须担忧利率、股市波动以及退体全不足以养老这一严酷现实。去年的大半年之中，布什总统领导了将社会保障体系变成储蓄账户
模式的改革运动，（在这种模式下，）退休人员的大部分或全部的“有保障的收入”变成了“依赖投资收益的收入”。对于较年轻的家庭来说，境况并没有好出丝毫。医疗保健的绝对成本以及其中家庭承担的份额都已提高——且新近流行的健康储蓄计划正从国会大厅蔓延到沃
尔玛员工那里，随之而来的是比过去高出许多的医疗保险免赔额，以及家庭未来的医疗保健所面临的大量新增投资风险。甚至人口统计数据都对中产阶级家庭不利，因为（据统计）家庭中出现年老力衰的父（母）——以及随之而来的体力和经济援助需要——的几率在仅仅一代人的时间里就猛涨到原来的八倍。

④From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not be far behind.
可以理解，从中产阶级家庭的角度看，上述许多现象看起来远不像是履行更多经济责任的机会，而更像是以骇人的增速将全融风险大规模转嫁到他们已经不堪重负的肩膀上。经济上的不良后果已经显现，政治影响也不会太远了。
