①For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement _Parade_ has featured a column called “Ask Marilyn.” People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 – the highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What’s the difference between love and fondness? Or what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It’ s not obvious how the capacity to visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
在过去几年中，报纸周日副刊《大观》开设了一版名为“问问玛丽莲”的特色专栏。人们被邀请向玛丽莲·沃斯·莎凡提问，她在 10 岁时测得的智力水平相当于普通人 23 岁左右，也就是智商为 228，这是有记录以来的最高分数。IQ 测试要求你完成文宇和视觉类推、想象纸张经折叠和剪切后的形状、推导数字序列，以及其他类似的任务。因此，莎凡能巧妙应对（智商为 100 的）普通人提出的诸如“爱与喜爱有何区别”或“运气和巧合的本质是什么”这类问题, 这有点令人费解。想象物体（形状）和破解数值模式的能力如何能使人解答那些曾难倒一些最优秀诗人和哲学家的问题，这一点难以理解。

②Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
显然，智力不止包含一次测试的一个得分。那么什么才叫“聪明”呢？智力有多少可以被明确 (测知)？我们从神经学、遗传学、计算机科学和其他领域中又能对智力了解多少呢?

③The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in adult and children’ s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant’ s are no longer possible, because scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
尽管如今 IQ 测试已经不像以前那么频繁地被使用，但 IQ 分数似乎仍是定义人类智力的术语。IQ 测试主要有两种形式：斯坦福一比纳智力量表和韦克斯勒智力量表（二者都有成人版和儿童版）。这两种测试形式费用一般为几百美元，通常只由心理学家提供，不过他们的改编版本在书店和互联网上随处可见。像莎凡那样的超高分数不可能再出现，因为现在分数计算是以同龄群体在统计学意义上的人口分布为基础的，而不是简单地用智力年龄除以生理年龄再乘以 100。其他标准化测试，比如学术评估测验（SAT）和研究生入学考试（GRE），都充分体现了 IQ 测试的主要特点。

④Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article “How Intelligent Is Intelligence Testing?”, Sternberg notes that traditional tests best assess analytical and verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership – that is, it predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking skill also matters, whether it's knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
罗伯特·J·斯特恩伯格指出，这类标准化测试也许不能评估在学业和生活中取得成功所必需的所有重要因素。斯特恩伯格在他的《智力测试有多智能?》一文中指出传统测试能够对分析能力和语言能力做出最佳评估，但不能评估创造能力和实践知识，而这两个因素对于解
决问题和在生活中取得成功也至关重要。此外，一旦受试群体或环境发生变化，IQ 测试不一定能做出准确预测。研究发现，当（受试者）在压力小的情况下进行测试时，IQ 能预示领导能力（的高低）；但是在压力大的情况下，IQ 与领导能力负相关——也就是说，根据智
商预测出的领导能力与实际情况相反。任何熬过“学术能力评估测试”的人都可以证明，应试技巧也很重要，无论是知道何时应该猜测或是（知道）何题应该跳过。
