①If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006’s World Cup tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.
如果查看一下 2006 年世界杯赛所有足球运动员的出生证，你很可能会发现一件引人注意的奇事：出类拔萃的足球运动员更可能出生在一年中的头几个月而非后几个月。如果再看看为世界杯和职业球队输送人才的欧洲各国国家青年队（队员出生证），你会发现这一奇怪现象甚至更为显著。

②What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania;d) none of the above.
这一奇怪现象可能的成因是什么呢？以下是几种猜测：a）某些星座赐予球员高超的足球技能；b）冬季出生的婴孩往往具有更高的血液携氧能力，这会增加踢足球时的耐力；c）痴迷足球的父母更可能在春天，也即每年足球狂热的巅峰时期受孕；d）以上都不是。

③Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he believes strongly in “none of the above.” Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly  30 years ago, involved memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. “With the first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,” Ericsson recalls. “He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen to over 80 numbers.”
安德斯·艾利克森，佛罗里达州立大学一位 58 岁的心理学教授，称他坚信“以上都不对”。艾利克森在瑞典长大，起初攻读核能工程学，直到他意识到如果转学心理学，会有更多机会从事自己的研究。他的首次实验，大约在 30 年前，与记忆力相关：训练一个人听一组随机数字, 随后进行复述。“在约 20 个小时训练之后，第一位被试者的数字记忆跨度从 7 个增加至 20 个，“”艾利克森四忆道，“他不断地进步，约 200 个小时训练之后，他能记住 80 多个数字。”

④This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more  of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences  are swamped by how well each person “encodes” the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
这次成功，加上后续的表明记忆力本身并非由基因决定的研究，使得艾利克森得出结论: 记忆行为与其说是一种直觉活动，不如说是一种认知活动。换句话说，不论两个人在记忆能力方面表现出什么先天性差异，这些差异都被个人“编码”信息能力的强弱所掩盖。艾利克森断定，学习有目的地编码信息的最佳方法是一个被称为“刻意练习”的过程。“刻意练习”需要的不仅仅是简单地重复任务，确切地讲，它需要制定明确目标、获取即时反馈并且要技巧与结果并重。

⑤Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers——whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming ——are nearly always made, not born.
艾利克森和他的同事由此开始沉酒于研究众多领域 (包括足球) 的出色表现者。他们收集能够收集到的所有资料，不仅包括工作表现统计数据和生平详细资料，还包括他们在自己实验室里对杰出人才所做实验的结果。他们的研究结论相当令人震惊: 我们通常称之为“天赋”的这一特质被过于高估了。或者，换句话说，不管是在记忆力还是外科手术领域，是在芭蕾舞是在计算机编程方面，表现出色的人几乎都是造就的，而不是天生的。
