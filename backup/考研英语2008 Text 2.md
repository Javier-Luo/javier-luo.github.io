①It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then remove the authors’ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher,  and researchers seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
它曾是如此直接。在实验室通力合作的一组研究人员将他们的研究成果呈递给一份期刊。之后该期刊的某位编辑会隐去论文上作者的名字和所属机构，并送交同行专家评审。该编辑会根据收到的（专家）意见来决定是否同意发表该论文。论文的版权归属于期刊出版商，想要查询该研究成果相关信息的研究者不得不订阅该期刊。

②No longer. The Internet – and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting access to it – is making free access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavour.
（情形）不再如此。因特网——以及来自资助机构的压力，这些机构质问，商业出版商为什么通过限制科研成果的获取从政府资助的研究项目中获利——正在使自由获取科研成果成为现实。经济合作与发展组织（OECD）刚刚发布了一份报告阐述了这一变化的深远影响。
这篇由澳大利亚维多利亚大学的约翰·霍顿和 OECD 的格菜汉姆·维克利共同撰写的报告，让那些迄今为止赚取了丰厚利润的出版商读起来心情沉重。但其意义不止于此，它还标志着科学探索目前为止的一个关键要素发生的一种变化。

③The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
知识的价值以及科研公共投资的回报某种程度上取决于其广泛的传播和容易的获取。这是门大生意。在美国，核心科学出版市场的估值在 70 亿到 110 亿美元之间。国际科学、技术和医学出版商协会称，全球有超过 2000 家出版公司专门从事这些学科（科学、技术和医学）的出版，它们每年在近 16,000 种期刊中刊登超过 120 万篇论文。

④This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the report’s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication of papers.
这一情形如今正在改变。根据 OECD 的这份报告，目前已有约 75%的学术期刊上线。全新的商业模式正在涌现。报告作者明确指出了三种主要的模式。第一种是所谓的“大订单”模式，机构订户通过网站许可协议付费获取一大批网络期刊的（阅读）权限。第二种是开放存取出版，通常依靠作者（或其所属机构）支付论文出版费用。第三种是开放存取知识库，由大学或国际实验室这样的组织资助（建立）机构储存库。现有的其他模式是这三种的混合，如延期开放存取，即，期刊在（论文发表后的）前六个月只允许付费订调者阅读论文，之后免费提供给所有想阅读的人。所有这一切可能会改变传统的同行评议程序，至少对于论文出版是如此。
