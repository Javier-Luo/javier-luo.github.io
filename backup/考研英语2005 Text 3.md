①Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” – the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”
在一夜好眠的所有因素中，梦似乎是最无法控制的。在梦中，有一扇窗通向逻辑暂时失效、死人开口说话的世界。一个世纪前弗洛伊德创立了他的革命性理论--梦是人们无意识的欲望和恐惧所伪装的影子; 到了 20 世纪 70 年代末，神经学家们转而认为梦仅仅是““精神噪音”——睡眠期间持续进行的神经修复活动的随机副产品。现在，研究者觉察到梦是大脑情绪自动调节系统的组成部分，当大脑处于“离线”状态时对情绪进行调整。一位有影响力的权威人士认为，这种异常重要的精神活动不仅能被利用，事实上还可以将其置于有意识的控制之下，以使得我们的睡眠质量更高、心情更好。芝加哥医疗中心心理部主任罗莎琳德·卡特赖特说：“这是你的梦。若不喜欢它，就改变它。”

②Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep – when most vivid dreams occur – as it is when fully awake, says Dr. Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally involved; the limbic system (the “emotional brain”) is especially active, while the prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. “We wake up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings  can stay with us all day.” says Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
来自大脑成像的证据证实了这个观点。匹兹堡大学的埃里克博士说，大脑在快速动眼睡眠中——大多数清晰梦境出现的时刻——和完全清醒时一样活跃。但并非大脑的所有部分都同等活跃，脑边缘系统（“情绪脑”）异常活跃，而前额皮层（思维和推理的中心地带）则相对平静。斯坦福睡眠研究员威廉·迪蒙特博士说：“我们从梦中醒来，无论是高兴还是沮丧这些情绪都会伴随我们一整天。”

③The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright’s clinic. Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don’t always think about the emotional significance of the day’s events – until, it appears, we begin to dream.
梦和情绪的关联在卡特赖特诊所的病人身上显露出来。大多数人似乎在晚上入睡早期做更多不好的梦，而在醒来前会逐渐做开心一些的梦，这说明人们在梦里逐渐化解白天所产生的负面情绪。因为我们有意识的大脑被日常事务占据，所以并不总能思考白天所发生的重大事件的情感意义——似乎直到开始做梦时才会。

④And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
这一过程未必是无意识的。卡特赖特认为人们可以对不断重现的噩梦施加有意识的控制。一醒来，立刻确定梦中是什么在困扰你。想象一下你想要它如何结束；下次再做同样的梦时，尽量及时醒来以控制它的进程。多加练习，人们真的可以学会在梦中这样做。

⑤At the end of the day, there’s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at all unless they keep us from sleeping or “we wake up in a panic,” Cartwright says. Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people’s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep – or rather dream – on it and you’ll feel better in the morning.
总的来说，我们几乎没有理由在意所做的梦，除非它们使我们无法安睡或“从惊恐中醒来”卡特赖特认为。恐怖主义、经济不确定及常见的不安全感都增加了人们的焦虑。那些长期遭受梦魇折磨的人应该寻求治疗专家帮助。对其他人来说，大脑有其化解不良情绪的方法。枕着忧虑睡觉甚至入梦，早上醒来时你会感觉好多了。
