①In spite of “endless talk of difference,” American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference” characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into “a culture of consumption” launched by the 19th-century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite” these were stores “anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.
尽管“无休止地谈论差异”，美国社会却是一部使人们同化的惊人机器。大众文化有着“服饰和言语上大众化的一致，以及随意和不拘礼节”的特征。人们被一种由 19 世纪的百货商场掀起的“消费文化”所同化，这些商店“在体面的环境中供应琳琅满目的商品”。这些不是迎合知识精英的私密商店，而是“不论阶级或背景，任何人都可以进入的百货商店。这使得购物转变为一种公共和大众的行为”。大众传媒、广告和体育赛事是同化的其他推动力。

②Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today’s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of the population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation – language, home ownership and intermarriage.
移民正在快速融入这种共同文化，这也许不太具有提升作用，但也几乎不可能有什么害处。在为“国家移民论坛”撰稿时，格雷戈里·罗德里格兹写道，如今的移民既未达到前所未有的水平也没有拒斥同化。1998 年移民占人口总数的 9.8%，1900 年占 13.6%。在 1990 年之前的 10 年中，每有 1000 个居民，便有 3.1 个移民初次来到（美国）；在 1890 年之前的 10 年中，二者比值为 9.2：1000。现在，考虑一下同化的三个指标——语言、住房自有和异族通婚。

③The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English ‘well’ or ‘very well’ after ten years of residence.” The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. “By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families.” Hence the description of America as a “graveyard” for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
1990 年人口普查结果显示，“来自于 15 个最常见原籍国的大多数移民在居住十年后英语都讲得‘不错’或‘非常好’”。移民的子女往往通晓双语并精通英语。“到了第三代，族裔语言在大部分移民家庭中已经消失。”因此美国被形容为语言的“墓地”。到 1996 年止，1970年前到达的、外国出生的移民住房自有率达 75.6%，高于本国出生的美国人 69.8%的比例。

④Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics “have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks.” By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.
外国出生的亚裔和西班牙裔移民的异族通婚率比美国本土出生的黑人和白人的异族通婚率要高”。到了第三代，三分之一的西班牙裔女性嫁给了非西班牙裔，41%的亚裔美国女性嫁给了非亚裔。

⑤Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet “some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation’s assimilative power.”
罗德里格兹指出，世界各地偏远乡村的儿童都是像阿诺德·施瓦辛格和加斯·布鲁克斯这样的超级明星的粉丝，然而“有些美国人担心，居住在美国境内的移民依然以某种方式不受这个国家同化力量的影响”。

⑥Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America’s turbulent past, today’s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.
在美国存在引起分歧的问题和小范围涌动的怒火吗? 确实存在。美国太大，什么情形都会有一点。但是，尤其在美国动荡过去的背景下来看，今天的社会指标几乎并未显示出一种黯淡退化的社会环境。
