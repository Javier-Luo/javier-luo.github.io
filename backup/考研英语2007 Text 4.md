①It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them——especially in America——the  sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on the boss’ s agenda in businesses of every variety.
不雨则已，雨则倾盆。正值老板、董事会们总算解决了最为棘手的财务和合规问题，并且改善了薄弱的公司治理之际，一个新的问题又可能为他们惹来——尤其是在美国——那种不可避免地使管理层受重罚的负面头条，这个问题就是：数据不安全此前，信息保护一直是由古怪而又低级的信息技术员工来负责，并且被看作只是诸如银行、电信、航空旅行这类拥有大量数据的行业才关注的问题，而现在却高居各行业老板的议程表之首。

②Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year – from organizations as diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley – have left managers hurriedly peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential vulnerabilities.
今年几起重大的客户和员工数据泄露事件——发生于各类机构里，如时代华纳公司、美国国防项目承包商科学应用国际公司、甚至加州大学伯克利分校——使得管理者们慌忙检查自身复杂精细的信息技术系统和业务流程，以寻找潜在的漏洞。

③“Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,” says Haim Mendelson of Stanford University’ s business school. “The ability to guard customer data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of shareholders”. Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, suggested Eli Noam of New York’ s Columbia Business School. “Setting the proper investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a technical one,” he says.
斯坦福大学商学院的海姆·孟德尔森说:“数据正在变成一种资产，与任何其他资产一样，它也需要受到保护。保护客户数据的能力是（保证）市场价值的关键，董事会应当为了股东的利益对市场价值负责。”的确，正如有一般公认会计原则（GAAP）的概念一样，或许现在是该制定一般公认安全原则（GAAP）的时候了，纽约哥伦比亚大学商学院的伊菜·诺姆这样建议道。他指出：“为（数据）安全、冗余以及恢复设立恰当的投资标准是个管理问题，而不是技术问题。”

④The mystery is that this should come as a surprise  to any boss. Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore – and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
难以理解的是，这竟然令所有的老板们都大吃一惊。无疑的是，即使最愚笨的管理人员也应该会清楚地知道：信任，也即经济资产中最具价值的东西，很容易遭到破坏而修复起来代价高昂；没有什么事情比企业任由个人敏感信息落入别有用心的人手中更能破坏信任的了。

⑤The current state of affairs may have been encouraged – though not justified –   by the lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America’ s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.
（美国，而不是欧洲）欠缺针对数据泄露的法律惩处，这种情况虽不至于证明当前事态合理，但却可能助长其发展。加州最近通过了一项法律，在此之前，美国的公司在数据丢失时无需通知任何人，甚至是受害者本人。这种情况可能很快就会改变：大量有关数据安全的立法提案正在国会接受审议。与此同时，美国 6 月 17 日披露的一起涉及大约 4000 万信用卡账户的信息失窃案，又使得美国联邦贸易委员会头一天（16 日）做出的一项极为重大的决议——该决议警告美国商界，如果公司不能充分保障数据的安全，那么监管机构就会采取措施——颜面尽失。
