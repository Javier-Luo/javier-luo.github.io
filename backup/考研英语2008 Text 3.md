①In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of the only three players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have changed dramatically over the years, and managers have  been more than willing to adjust team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.
20 世纪 60 年代初，威尔特·张伯伦是被列入全国篮球协会（NBA）超过七英尺的仅有三名球员之一。然而，假若上个赛季他还在打球的话，他就会是 42 名这样的球员中的一员了。多年以来，从事主要职业运动的运动员身材发生了显著变化，经理们一直在欣然调整队服，以适合越来越多更大更高的身躯。

②The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today’s people – especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations – apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren’t likely to get any taller. “In the general population today, at  this genetic, environmental level, we’ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,” says anthropologist William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting players from all over the world.
然而，体育界的这种趋势可能正在掩盖一个未被注意到的事实：美国人的身高总体上已停止增长。尽管比 140 年前普遍高约两英寸，但现在的美国人——尤其是那些出生于已在美国生活好几代的家庭中的美国人——在 20 世纪 60 年代初就明显已达身高极限。他们不大可能再有任何身高增长了。莱特州立大学的人类学家威廉·卡梅隆·查姆利称:“就当今总人群而言，在现有的基因和环境水平下，我们的身高几乎已达极限。”至于 NBA 球员，他们身高的增长似乎是“从世界各地招募球员”这种日益普遍做法的结果。

③Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients – notably, protein – to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height – 5′9″ for men, 5′4″ for women – hasn’t really changed since 1960.
身高增长需要热量和营养——尤其是蛋白质——以满足组织扩展的需求。人在 20 岁以后很少会继续长高了。20 世纪之初，营养不足和儿童传染病阻碍了身高的增长。然而，随着饮食和健康状况的改善，儿童和青少年的身高每 20 年平均增长约 1.5 英寸，这种模式被称为身高（增长）的长期趋势。然而根据疾病控制与预防中心的数据，平均身高——男性 5 英尺9 英寸，女性 5 英尺 4 英寸——自 1960 年以来并未真正改变过。

④Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by oversize limbs. “There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture of the individual organism,” says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern University.
从基因角度来讲，避免身材过高是有好处的。分娩过程中，较大的婴儿更难通过产道。此外，尽管人类已经直主行走了几百万年，但两足和背部仍继续同两足行走的姿势相抗衡，因而难以轻易承受过大过长的肢体反复施加的压力。西北大学人类学家威廉·伦纳德称:“对身高的一些真正限制是由个体有机体的基因结构所设定的”。

⑤Genetic maximums can change, but don’t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of equipment, Gordon says that by and large, “you could use today’s data and feel fairly confident.”
基因最大值可能会改变，但别期望它根快就会发生。马萨诸塞州内蒂克陆军研究中心的资深人类学家克莱尔·戈登保证，90%的制服和工作台适合新兵，无需改动。她说，和篮球运动员的队服不同，军服尺寸一段时间以来从未改动。她还说，如果你需要预测在不久的将来人类的身高以设计一件装备，那基本上“你可以非常有把握地使用当前数据”。
