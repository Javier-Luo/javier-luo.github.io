①Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, _Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should Like, Care_, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.
无论在演讲还是在写作上，美国人都不再期望公众人物在英语语言的使用上展现出技能与天赋：而公众人物自身也不渴求有这种语言驾驭能力。约翰·麦荷特——不仅是语言学家，而且是一位混杂着自由派与保守派观点的善辩者——在其新书《做我们自己的事：语言和音乐的退化，以及为什么我们应该，呃，在意》中认为，20 世纪 60 年代反文化运动的胜利是导致正式英语衰落的主要原因。

②Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter’s academic speciality is language history and change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of “whom”, for example,  to be natural and no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
责怪纵容放任的 20 世纪 60 年代并不新鲜，但这次却不是对教育退步的又一场批判。麦荷特先生的学术专长是语言的历史与变迁。举例来说，他认为“whom”一词的逐渐消失是自然的，和古英语中词格尾缀的消失一样根本没什么可遗憾的。

③But the cult of the authentic and the personal, “doing our own thing”, has spelt the death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. In both oral and written English, <u>talking</u> is triumphing  over speaking, spontaneity over craft.
然而，对真实和个性的狂热推崇，即“做我们自己的事”，已经招致了正式的演讲、写作、诗歌及音乐的消亡。在 20 世纪 60 年代以前，就算是受教育不太多的人在下笔时都会寻求一种高格调；而在那之后, 即使是最受好评的文章也力求在书面上体现口语化。同样，在诗歌方面，极具个性化与表现力的风格是唯一能够体现真实生动的形式。无论是在口语还是书面语中，随意言谈胜过了正式讲话，即兴发挥也胜过了精雕细琢。

④Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be powerfully expressive – there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight because we do not talk proper.
麦荷特先生从雅俗文化中列举了大量有趣的例子，从而说明他所记录的趋势是确凿无疑的。但就书中副标题提出的问题“为什么我们应该，呃，在意”，答案却不够明确。作为语言学家，麦荷特承认人类各种各样的语言，包括像黑人英语这样的非标准语言，都具有强大的表达力——世上没有传达不了复杂思想的语言或方言。与其他大多数人不同，麦荷特先生并没有坚持认为“我们说话方式不规范就会让我们无法准确地思考”。

⑤Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech  that would seem old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms – he is really grieving over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English “on paper plates instead of china”. A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
俄罗斯人深爱自己的语言，他们的脑海中深印着大段大段的诗歌；而意大利的政客们则往往精心准备演讲，尽管这在大多数讲英语的人们看来已经过时了。麦荷特先生承认正式语言并非绝对的不可或缺，他也没有提议要进行彻底的教育改革——他其实只是为那些美好多过实用的事物的消逝而哀叹。我们现在用“纸盘”而非“瓷盘”盛着我们的英语大餐。这或许令人遗憾, 但也许又是不可避免的。
