In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just \u201cmental noise\u201d \u2013 the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind\u2019s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is \u201coff-line.\u201d And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. \u201cIt\u2019s your dream,\u201d says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago\u2019s Medical Center. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, change it.\u201d\n\u5728\u4e00\u591c\u597d\u7720\u7684\u6240\u6709\u56e0\u7d20\u4e2d\uff0c\u68a6\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u6700\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1751409447, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://tgimg-dfe.pages.dev/file/AgACAgUAAyEGAASY6BlGAAMMaGRclk3iStA-o9Ve4LcUnSumRmQAAoLLMRtMkChX0G22A5bcAqUBAAMCAAN3AAM2BA.jpg", "createdDate": "2025-07-02", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"bug": "#d73a4a", "documentation": "#0075ca", "duplicate": "#cfd3d7", "enhancement": "#a2eeef", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "help wanted": "#008672", "invalid": "#e4e669", "question": "#d876e3", "Reading Comprehension": "#6bfcae", "wontfix": "#ffffff"}, "displayTitle": "Javier", "faviconUrl": "https://tgimg-dfe.pages.dev/file/AgACAgUAAyEGAASY6BlGAAMMaGRclk3iStA-o9Ve4LcUnSumRmQAAoLLMRtMkChX0G22A5bcAqUBAAMCAAN3AAM2BA.jpg", "ogImage": "https://tgimg-dfe.pages.dev/file/AgACAgUAAyEGAASY6BlGAAMMaGRclk3iStA-o9Ve4LcUnSumRmQAAoLLMRtMkChX0G22A5bcAqUBAAMCAAN3AAM2BA.jpg", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://javier-luo.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
