Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In his latest book, _Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We Should Like, Care_, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the decline of formal English.
无论在演讲还是在写作上，美国人都不再期望公众人物在英语语言的使用上展现出技能与天赋：而公众人物自身也不渴求有这种语言驾驭能力。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://javier-luo.github.io/post/kao-yan-ying-yu-2005%20Text%204.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:42:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>考研英语2005 Text 3</title><link>https://javier-luo.github.io/post/kao-yan-ying-yu-2005%20Text%203.html</link><description>①Of all the components of a good night’s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists had switched to thinking of them as just “mental noise” – the random byproducts of the neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part of the mind’s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is “off-line.” And one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better. “It’s your dream,” says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago’s Medical Center. “If you don’t like it, change it.”

That the evidence was inconclusive, the science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
还记得那些年吗？科学家们提出吸烟会使我们丧命，而怀疑者们却坚称我们对此无法定论；他们坚称证据不确凿，科学不确定；他们坚称反对吸烟的游说者企图破坏我们的生活方式，而政府应该置身事外。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://javier-luo.github.io/post/kao-yan-ying-yu-2005%20Text%202.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:01:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>考研英语2005 Text 1</title><link>https://javier-luo.github.io/post/kao-yan-ying-yu-2005%20Text%201.html</link><description>①Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as “all too human”, with the underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in _Nature_, suggests that &lt;u&gt;it is all too monkey&lt;/u&gt;, as well.
